# This is a simple telegram bot created for tracking new messages in personal chats, groups or channels
### Setup.
Before installing dependencies, go to [here](https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps) and authorize. After authorization, copy the values in the `api_id` and `api_hash` fields and save them somewhere.

After that, go to the telegram bot [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new bot. After creating the bot, copy the **bot token** that botfather will give you and save it too.
