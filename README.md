# This is a simple telegram bot created for tracking new messages in personal chats, groups or channels
### Setup.
Before installing dependencies, go to [here](https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps) and authorize. After authorization, copy the values in the `api_id` and `api_hash` fields and save them somewhere.

Then go to the telegram bot [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new bot. After creating the bot, copy the **bot token** that botfather will give you and save it too. After these steps, install Python 3.x. I'm using Python version 3.12.1


Create a virtual environment and go to it.

Windows:
```
python -m venv channelTrackerVenv
cd channelTrackerVenv
```
Linux:
```
python3 -m venv channelTrackerVenv
cd channelTrackerVenv
```

Then clone this repository into your virtual environment folder: 
```
git clone https://github.com/mananex/telegram-channel-tracker.git
```
...or download the archive of this repository and unzip it.
