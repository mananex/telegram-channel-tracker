### How does the script work?
After the script has launched successfully, go to your bot created using BotFather and launch it.

The bot will send you a message with the `ðŸ’¬ Chats` button. After clicking this button the bot will send a message with a list of chats that it is monitoring. 

* To add a new chat click on the button `âž• Add New`.
* To change the listening status of a chat click on its status.
* To delete a listening chat, click on its name and in a new message click on the `Delete chat` button.

**Important note:** After running the script for the bot to start tracking messages in active chats, click on the `ðŸ’¬ Chats` button. Without this, the script **will not** start tracking. This only needs to be done **once** after the script has been run.
